# Survey Form

A large form meant to take feedback from users. Site is integrated with semantic HTML5 tags, making SEO better.

## Lessons Learned

Enjoyed making a long survey form with many elements to manage. Taught me how to mark classes and id's with clear, understandable names. Learned how to implement input fields in an HTML document.

Needed to incorporate separation of concerns moreso than before, considering the volume of elements needing styling. Became familiar with the practice of using semantic HTML tags for sites to provide better SEO optimizaiton and for better Accessibility.

## Possible Future Updates

* Change all styling into SASS to compressed code.
* Subtlely animated background for an engaging design.
* Funcitonal submit button that returns results to server.
* Light/Dark mode switcher.

## Deployment

This site was deployed using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
